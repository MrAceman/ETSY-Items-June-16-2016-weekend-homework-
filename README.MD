## ETSY Items - Higher Order Functions Project

This HTML, CSS, and JS was created over the weekend of June 16th through June 19th, 2016.  The goal was to take the items.js data file provided by Brit and generate the HTML, CSS, and JS needed to answer and display 6 questions.

The primary purpose of this exercise was to work on use of higher order functions to parse and return data from a large array.
